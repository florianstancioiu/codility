# Messy list of Quora answers for best algorithms to know (to be analyzed and processed) 

Sieve of Eratosthenes, or another prime number sieve
Depth-first search
Breadth-first search
Dijkstra's algorithm
Floyd--Warshall algorithm
Either Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm
Some implementation of topological sorting, such as by using DFS
Convex hull (I recommend the Monotone Chains algorithm)
Coordinate compression
Edmonds--Karp, or another implementation of the Ford--Fulkerson method; or a preflow-push algorithm; or, if you are preparing an ACM codebook, Dinic's algorithm. (Note: Max flow is not allowed to appear on the IOI, but may nevertheless appear on national team-selection contests)

==============================================================

1. Evaluating mathematical expressions, this can be warm up and will let you know that problems are not easy to solve nor very tough to solve.
Example input will be a mathematical expression like: (A+B*C-D*(A-C)+A) and A=2, B=3, C=7,D=8, output will be the value of the expression at the given input point.
 2. DFS and BFS, I believe graph is the most general model in computer science and problem solving, you need to have a good traversal algorithm.
3. Longest common subsequence. To understand dynamic programming, this will also make you learn divide and conquer. As Dynamic programming = Divide and conquer + Memoization.
4. A*, finding optimised path in large graphs, finding best path, optimised solution you'll get and learn AI, you'll also learn one of the most important algorithm - Dijkstra's algorithm, finding shortest path, as A* is extension of it.
5. Quicksort using median of medians as pivot, you'll learn one of the best sorting technique, and using median of medians you'll learn magic of approximation. Have a look at merge sort also. Have a look at insertion sort, you'll learn online algorithm and amortized analysis.
6. index based sorting, this will help you understand that sometimes you can go beyond the lower bound by using everything stored in memory.
7. Any convex hull finding algorithm, that will introduce you to computational geometry, which has rich number of advance data structures.
8. Prim's algorithm, just for spending more times in graph and learning greedy approach.
9. Reading KMP algorithm, you'll learn out of box thinking, and string operations.
10. Making Finite automata, PDA, turing machine, this will give you another level of thinking when solving problems.

==============================================================

1. Number theory algorithms: GCD, inverse of the number using extended euler's algorithm, fast power, prime number
2. Graph algorithms: BFS, DFS, Shortest path algorithms, all pairs shortest path
3. String pattern matching: KMP (Sometimes, it is efficient for large input size), tries
4. Segment trees: Many problems in Code chef are related to segment trees.
5. Data Structures: Array, linked list, Priority Queue using heap, unordered sets, stacks and queues, hash and binary search tree  (Sometimes algorithms are based on them like palindrome check)
6. Search: Binary search, search using hash map, trie (also on rotated array)
7. Dynamic programming: Basics of dynamic programming, Matrix chain multiplication, LCS, Edit Distance, 0-1 Knapsack, Bellman ford,
8. Greedy: Job scheduling, Prims, Kruskal
9. Sorting: Heap sort, quick sort, merge sort (efficient for linked list too), counting sort and radix sort


================================================================


If you want specific algorithms, my top 10 would be:

    Dijkstra's - depending on the type of contest, you might see basic pathfinding problems, or you might see problems with non-obvious reductions to pathfinding problems. Whenever you have a cost minimization problem with a (reasonably small) finite number of states, an initial state and a target state, you can look at it as a pathfinding problem.
    Bellman-Ford is useful for pathfinding when edges may have negative costs. For example if you're navigating a maze with potions which boost health and hazards which lower it, Bellman-Ford would be a great approach.
    Floyd-Warshall is useful for computing all paths. It is sometimes used in problems where you don't need all paths, because it's so easy to implement. It is slower than other pathfinding algorithms though, so whether Floyd-Warshall is an option depends on the graph size.
    Edmonds-Karp for max flow/min cut problems. One common application is bipartite matching problems. For example, given N people, M food items, and a list of each person's food allergies, how many people can you feed?
    The Hungarian algorithm for assignment problems. Similar to the above, but in these problems the edges have weights, and we're maximizing the total weight rather than just the number of matchings.
    The sweep line "algorithm" (more of a general approach really) is useful for various geometric problems, like the nearest pair problem. Also useful for a variety of intersection-related problems, like finding intersecting line segments, or conflicting calendar events.
    Graham scan or another convex hull algorithm, for problems such as building a minimal fence to enclose animals.
    An algorithm for finding strongly connected components, such as Tarjan's.
    Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.
    Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm for string searching.

Other concepts worth studying, which aren't in the above list because they aren't specific algorithms:

    Memoization/dynamic programming is quite useful. Some problems have obvious DP solutions, while others have very non-obvious ones which take practice to recognize.
    Binary search is useful in many optimization problems, so make sure you're very comfortable implementing it.
    Combinatorial game theory comes up now and then. I recommend Thomas Ferguson's introduction.
    Tries are useful in a variety of text-related problems.


===============================================================


1. Dynamic Programming : For one obvious reason - "Being Greedy doesn't necessarily work!"

2. Sorting algorithm : Unless the efficiency matters, anyone will do!

3. Search algorithm : I prefer binary search, but for most cases anything will do as long as it does it's job.

4. Dijkstra's algorithm : Well, being greedy sometimes work!

5. A* algorithms : A special case of best-first search. Very helpful in AI problems.

6. Backtracking : "Never forget where you came from".

7. Hash search or Hashing : Sometimes you do get bored of using binary search.

8. RSA/DSA : Some security.. finally!

9. Bellman-Ford : Just in case if the weights are negative!

10. Minimum Spanning Tree : It's the last one and actually you can live without this one!

===============================================================

1. Dynamic programming. It can solve lots of practical scenarios. When we use it in reinforcement learning, it can save the value of each state in each step.

2.Greedy. Most of the time it will give you the optimal answer, but be careful with some problems like coin changes.

3.Dijkstra. I didn't implement it that much, but I used to implement it in building optimal query trees.

4.Trees. Again, they are most popularly used algorithms. Just a simple example, when you want to develop an input method app for your own language, you might want to build an alphabetic tree at first.

Here is my list of top five:

    Time complexity -- without knowing it, how can you see the benefit of using a better algorithm,
    see e.g. https://codility.com/programmers...
    Or maybe is it so obvious and should be 0-th item?
    The "divide and conquer" principle -- basis of many algorithm and a very convenient algorithmic problem solving principle. Some handbook applications of this principle, like the binary search (see e.g. https://codility.com/programmers...), can be included here.
    The trinity of: backtracking, dynamic and greedy programming -- they will help you solve most problems up to the medium-high level.
    (See e.g. https://codility.com/programmers... and
    https://codility.com/programmers....)
