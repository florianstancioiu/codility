# Note
There are no problem descriptions in this repo because they are copyrighted by codility, in order to read the problem descriptions use the link included at the top of the solution files (if they exist).

# Optimization tips:

* __Read the material__
* __Learn about the O(n) notation__
* __Solve the problem on paper and check if the growth notation of your solution O(n) is acceptable__
* Avoid intricate for statements
* Avoid creating array variables
* Reduce the number of variables
* Reduce the number of if statements
* Reduce the number of for statements

# Testing tips:

* Test for at least 7 different additional cases:
* Empty array
* One element array
* Two elements array
* Three elements array with something wrong on the first element
* Three elements array with something wrong on the last element
* Three elements array, all having the same value
* Three elements array, all having extreme values
